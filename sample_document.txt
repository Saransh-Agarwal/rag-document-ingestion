RAG Document Ingestion Pipeline - Sample Document

Introduction
This is a sample document to demonstrate the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) document ingestion pipeline. The pipeline processes documents through multiple stages including fetching, parsing, embedding generation, and vector storage.

Architecture Overview
The system is built using several key components:

1. Temporal.io for workflow orchestration
2. Unstructured.io for document parsing
3. OpenAI API for embedding generation
4. Milvus for vector database storage

Key Features
- Asynchronous processing using Python asyncio
- Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Sophisticated text chunking strategies
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging
- Batch processing for efficient storage

Technical Implementation
The workflow consists of four main activities:

1. Document Fetching: Downloads documents from provided URLs with validation and size limits
2. Document Parsing: Extracts and chunks text using advanced parsing techniques
3. Embedding Generation: Creates vector embeddings for semantic search
4. Vector Storage: Stores chunks and embeddings in Milvus database

Concurrency and Performance
The system leverages Python's asyncio for efficient concurrent processing. This allows multiple I/O-bound operations to run simultaneously without blocking the event loop, significantly improving throughput and resource utilization.

Error Handling
Custom exception types are implemented for different error scenarios:
- DocumentFetchError for download issues
- DocumentParseError for parsing failures
- EmbeddingError for API-related problems
- StorageError for database issues

Each activity includes retry policies with exponential backoff to handle transient failures gracefully.

Monitoring and Observability
The system includes comprehensive metrics collection covering:
- Activity execution times
- Success and failure rates
- Resource usage statistics
- Processing throughput

Conclusion
This RAG document ingestion pipeline demonstrates best practices for building scalable, reliable document processing systems using modern Python technologies and cloud-native architectures.
